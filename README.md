# FileViewer
Due to macOS not allowing audio sharing while screen sharing, this web app functions as a work around as Google Chrome allows for audio sharing and screen sharing but only from one tab. The web app is designed to allow users to share a pdf and play an audio file at the same time, for example in order to facilitate foreign language classes

## Scripts
